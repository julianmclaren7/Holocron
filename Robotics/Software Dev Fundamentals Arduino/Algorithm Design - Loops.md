![[Theory#Algorithm Design - Loops]]

# Arduino Implementation

The Arduino language has the three loop structures identified on the General Learning Resource - `while`, `do..while` and `for`. As Arduino is a C-based language, the syntax for these are the same as with C, C++ etc.

Here you can see the syntax and an example of each.

## While Loop

```arduino
while (condition) {
  // statement(s)
}
```

### Example

```arduino
var = 0;
while (var < 200) {
  // do something repetitive 200 times
  var++;
}
```

## Do... While Loop

```arduino
do {
  // statement block
} while (condition);
```

### Example

```arduino
int x = 0;
do {
  delay(50);          // slight delay
  x = x + 1;          // add 1 to x.
} while (x < 100);
```

## For Loop

```arduino
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // statement(s);
}
```

### Example

```arduino
for (int i = 0; i <= 255; i++) {
	analogWrite(PWMpin, i);
	delay(10);
  }
```

‼️ Remember the *condition* has to equate to `true` or `false`.

# Practical Exercises

<aside>
🏁 **Goal**

In this task, you’ll be extending the Bank Alarm circuit by adding a number of additional LEDs to be used in a sequence. You will be using loops to access and cycle through the LEDs.

</aside>

Log into [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and access the classroom used previously. Open the activity `Bank Alarm`.

## Modifying the Bank Alarm Circuit

### Add more LEDs

Add four more LEDs and resistors, connecting them to pins 8, 7, 6 and 5.

Change the colours of the cables to make it easier to read. 

Each Ground wire should be black. 

Set the resistance for each resistor to 220 Ω.

At the end of the process, your wiring diagram should be similar to this.

## Adding functionality

To add additional functionality, you’ll be using loops to configure the LED pins as output and then be using other loops to access each LED.

Remove the `pinLED` constant and create an empty `for` loop in setup().

![[Untitled 40.png|Untitled]]

```arduino
for (int pinLED = 5; pinLED <= 9; pinLED++) {
   
}
```

Move the line `pinMode(pinLED, OUTPUT);` to be inside the for loop block.

![[Untitled 41.png|Untitled]]

```arduino
pinMode(pinLED, OUTPUT);
```

Update `setLEDBrightness()` to access the pins through a loop instead of writing to the individual pin. The `for` loop condition will be exactly the same as the one used in `setup()`.

![[Untitled 42.png|Untitled]]

```arduino
for (int pinLED = 5; pinLED <= 9; pinLED++) {
	analogWrite(pinLED, LEDBrightness);
  }
```

## Test the Functionality

Run the simulation and test to ensure that the functionality is as expected. 

<aside>
‼️ You may notice there’s an issue with two of the LEDs - It’s got to do with something called **Pulse Width Modulation**. Can you work out what the issue is?

# Extension Exercises

1. Using a for loop, set pins 2 to 5 as OUTPUT pins. Do this in setup(). 
	1. Attach LEDs to pins 2 to 5 (inclusive). Update loop(), using a for loop, to turn each each LED on, wait a second, and then turn them off in another for loop.

1. In a new Circuit, attach a button to pin 2 and a LED to pin 10. Using a while loop, code the circuit to turn the LED on when the button is pressed, and off when the button is not pressed.

## Answers

This video shows how to approach and solve the first question, using For loops to access LEDs on different pins with efficient code.

# Review

1. What is the difference between the available types of loops? Why choose one of the other/s?
2. How many times can loops iterate?
3. Write the steps in plain language, **using loops**, to 
	1. Read in individual lines of a text file (use the one shown)
	2. Calculate the GST
	3. Output the GST component to the user.
