# Arduino Implementation

Arduino is a subset of the C++ language. C++, invented in 1985, is an extension to C, which was invented in 1972. So, the basis for the language is quite old, in computer science terms. Luckily the Arduino language simplifies some aspects of C++ to suit the Arduino environment.

Consider the code sample for `Blink`. 

## Brackets

Notice the use of brackets - () and {} - these are very important in the Arduino language (as they are in C and C++). 

<aside>
💡 Each open bracket, whichever type, must have a corresponding close bracket.

</aside>

The standard brackets - or parentheses - indicate **conditions** and **parameters** and **arguments**. 

The Curly Brackets - { and } - indicate the start and the end of a code block. This code block can be a **function** (as can be seen in the image with `setup()` and `loop()`) and also with **decisions** and **loops**.

## Semicolon

The details of these topics will be discussed later in the course - just be aware of the different brackets and their uses at this stage.

You may also notice that *almost* each line of code shown ends with a semi-colon. In C-based languages (Java, javascript, Arduino etc), the semi-colon identifies the end of a statement.

## Whitespace

In programming, whitespace refers to the use of indentation (tabs), space characters new newline characters.

In Arduino, the compiler generally ignores whitespace, meaning you can have as many blank lines in your code as you wish - the code will still compile.

Indentation is also not critical, however it makes it easier to read code blocks if indented correctly.

<aside>
💡 CTRL+T is the shortcut to auto-format your code and fix up indentation.

# Practical Exercises

In a Google Doc write the sequence involved in you making toast.

Update the blink code, to include a second (or third) LED, and code the LEDs to cycle through - e.g. RED, then GREEN, then RED, then GREEN etc.
