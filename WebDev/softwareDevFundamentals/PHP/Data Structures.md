# PHP Implementation

## Arrays

`array()` is used in PHP to define an array.

Arrays are implemented in PHP to C-based languages, with square brackets - `[` and `]` - used to indicate the indexes being accessed.

```php
<?php
$starWarsMovies = array("A New Hope", "Empire Strikes Back", "Return Of the Jedi");
echo "I like " . $starWarsMovies[0] . ", " . $starWarsMovies[1] . " and " . $starWarsMovies[2] . ".<br>";
echo count($starWarsMovies);
?>
```

which will output

### Get the length of an Array

There is a common need to find the length of an array (how many elements there are). In PHP, you can use the `count()` function.

```php
<?php
$starWarsMovies = array("A New Hope", "Empire Strikes Back", "Return Of the Jedi");
echo "I like " . $starWarsMovies[0] . ", " . $starWarsMovies[1] . " and " . $starWarsMovies[2] . ".";
echo count($starWarsMovies);
?>
```

which will output

<aside>
‼️ Remember - the length of an array is **always** one more than the index of the last element!

</aside>

## Key Value Pair

<aside>
‼️ In PHP, these are referred to as **Associative Arrays**. Otherwise, they are exactly the same.

</aside>

Similarly to ‘normal’ arrays, the `array()` keyword is used to define associative arrays.

```php
$subjectRooms = array("Website Development"=>"6118", "English"=>"3017", "Maths"=>"1120", "PE"=>"Gym", "Drama"=>"Theatre");
echo "Room Numbers: <br>";
echo "English: ".$subjectRooms["English"]."<br>";
echo "Maths: ".$subjectRooms["Maths"]."<br>";
echo "Website Development: ".$subjectRooms["Website Development"]."<br>";
echo "Drama: ".$subjectRooms["Drama"]."<br>";
echo "PE: ".$subjectRooms["PE"]."<br>";
```

will produce

## Looping through an Array

PHP has another loop type called `foreach` where you can access each element of an array - either a ‘normal’ array or an associative array.

The syntax for this is:

```php
foreach (iterable_expression as $value)
	statement
foreach (iterable_expression as $key => $value)
	statement]
```

`iteratable_expression` is the array you are iterating over.

`value` is the element of the current iteration

`key` is used with an associative array, where the key is also assigned along with the value.

### Example

```php
foreach ($subjectRooms as $subject => $roomNumber){
	echo "Subject - ".$subject.' - is in room '.$roomNumber."<br>";
}
```

<aside>
‼️ In the first iteration of this foreach loop, `key` will be "Website Development" and `value` will be “6118”.

# Practical Exercises

<aside>
🏁 **Goal**

In this task, you’ll centralise the product names and prices to use associative arrays.

</aside>

## Product Catalogue

Currently the Products are listed with hard coded prices, specified in `invoice.php` and the names of the products are only displayed in the HTML of the same page. Storing these in an associative array, at this stage, would be a upgrade to the system.

The new data can be saved in any page, however as the details are used on both  `invoiceList.php` and `orderForm.php` pages, this could be defined in `template.php`. 

<aside>
‼️ Eventually this data will be stored in a database, but that’s a future upgrade.

</aside>

Open `template.php` and define a new associative array in the php block.

<aside>
‼️ You can choose the product names and prices.

</aside>

![[_images/Untitled 22.png|Untitled]]

```php
$productNames = array("product1"=>"Darth Vader Helmet", "product2"=>"Grogu Plush", "product3"=>"ROTJ Jigsaw", "product4"=>"Aftermath", "product5"=>"Alphabet Squadron");
$productPrices= array("product1"=>299.0, "product2"=>32.95, "product3"=>219.95, "product4"=>24.95, "product5"=>24.95);
```

Save `template.php`. 

![[commonBlocks#Commit & Push]]

Open `orderForm.php` and update the Product Names that are outputted to use the `$productNames` associative array.

![[_images/Untitled 23.png|Untitled]]

```php
<?php echo $productNames["product1"]; ?>
```

Load the page in the Preview or browser and the item names should then appear.

![[_images/Untitled 24.png|Untitled]]

To remove the error that appears indicating that `productNames` is unknown, you can add the following code to the top PHP block. 

This indicates that the variable `productNames` will be used later in the code.

![[_images/Untitled 25.png|Untitled]]

```php
/** @var $productNames */
```

![[commonBlocks#Commit & Push]]

Open `invoice.php` and repeat the same process above, but also for the prices.

The hardcoded costs can be removed as they are not required anymore. **Delete** these variables.

```php
$prod1ItemCost = 3.4;
$prod2ItemCost = 5.0;
$prod3ItemCost = 12.54;
$prod4ItemCost = 19.77;
$prod5ItemCost = 1.01;
```

Update the subTotal calculations to use the `$productPrices` associative array. 

![[_images/Untitled 26.png|Untitled]]

```php
$prod1SubTotal = $prod1Quantity * $productPrices["product1"];
$prod2SubTotal = $prod2Quantity * $productPrices["product2"];
$prod3SubTotal = $prod3Quantity * $productPrices["product3"];
$prod4SubTotal = $prod4Quantity * $productPrices["product4"];
$prod5SubTotal = $prod5Quantity * $productPrices["product5"];
```

Similar to `orderForm.php` update the product name outputs to use the `$productNames` associative array.

![[_images/Untitled 27.png|Untitled]]

```php
<?php echo $productNames["product1"]; ?>
```

The displayed individual costs of each item will need to be updated as well.


> [!info] You may have noticed the different syntax - `<?=` is equivalent to `<?php echo`.


![[_images/Untitled 28.png|Untitled]]

Reload the page in the browser and the product names and prices should reflect the values set in the two associated arrays.

1. What are the main differences between an Array and a Key Value Pair.
2. What are multidimensional dimensional arrays? Describe them and show code examples for what they are and what they can do. What situations would you use a multidimensional array over other data structures?
